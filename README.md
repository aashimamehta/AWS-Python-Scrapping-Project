# AWS-Python-Scraping-Project

This project is about scraping a website using python. The libraries that I used in this project are pandas, Beautiful Soup, etc. I am scraping the website to extract relavant information about it. For Example: I scraped National Weather Website to extract the information about the weather in Seattle WA area. Then formatted them and published to a topic in AWS SNS. Using AWS SNS, we will be able to pass this useful information to all the users subscribed to our topic.
